<h1>Alzheimer Disease Detection</h1> 

<h2> DESCRIPTION </h2>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens and  it is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia.<br>

<h3> Signs and symptoms </h3>

- <b> Common Symptoms :</b>  Short Term Memory Loss ,  Stress or aging 

- <b> Early stage :</b> Speech Difficulties due to inability to recall vocabularies, Reading and writing skills also progressively lost.

- <b> Middle stage :</b> Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions.</b>

- <b> Late stage :</b> During the final stage, known as the late-stage or severe stage, there is complete dependence on caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech.</b>

<h1>WHAT THIS COVERED HERE</h1> 

- <b> Developed an Alzheimer disease detection System using Convolutional Neural Network Architecture.

- <b> Magnetic Resonance Imaging  Dataset for training the model.
